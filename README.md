Force Engine 2
==============

[Force Engine 2](http://ericleong.me/games/force-engine) is an [old](https://sites.google.com/site/t3hprogrammer/software/forceengine/history) physics engine with some game engine components written in Java. It is primarily a learning and research project focused on testing ideas around collision detection and response.

Tutorials and research papers are available for the [circle-circle collision](http://ericleong.me/research/circle-circle) and [circle-line collision](http://ericleong.me/research/circle-line) detection and response.

The project only depends on Java 6 and the libraries it comes with. It is open-sourced under the MIT license.

The easiest way to get the demo running is by opening the project with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) and running `ForceEngineDemo`.
